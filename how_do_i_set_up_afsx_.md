title: How do I set up afsx?

---
It's _**easy**_. First, you'll need an external storage device (HDD, SSD, USB, or optical media will all work). Next, download the base.zip file from the mega.nz link in the [repository](github.com/fierymewtwo/afsx). **Format your storage device as NTFS**, then extract the base.zip file to the root of the drive. You're ready to go!
